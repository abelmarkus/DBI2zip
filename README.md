# DBI2zip
Grab DBI's executable + config file then archive them into a zip.

NOTE:  
Now you can add https://github.com/abelmarkus/DBI2zip/releases/latest/download/DBI.zip to your favorite homebrew updater  
(I created a new 'custom download' into AIO Switch Updater and it works like a charm!)

And That's It!
